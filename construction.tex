\section{Construction}

We adopt the superblock-based NIPoPoW construction of~\cite{logspace}. The key
observation in our construction is that the verifier does not recalculate the
target, but only uses the target of the genesis epoch, $T_0$. This allows the
verifier to extract the chain with the most work.

Target recalculation by the verifier is not required because... TODO

The construction is shown in Algorithms~\ref{alg.compress}
and~\ref{alg.nipopow-verifier}.
