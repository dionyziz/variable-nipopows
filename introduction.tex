\section{Introduction}

Traditional blockchain full nodes download the whole blockchain to synchronize
with their network. The first improvement over this was put forth in the
original Bitcoin paper in the form of SPV clients, which download only block
headers, but still require a download linear in the size of the blockchain.
Superlight clients implement the Non-Interactive Proof of Proof-of-Work
(NIPoPoWs) primitive to download data exponentially smaller than SPV clients,
observing only a logarithmic sample of blocks from the whole chain. Previous
work has only implemented NIPoPoWs for the case of fixed difficulty. However,
practical blockchains have difficulty which is recalculated in every epoch. We
study the problem of creating superlight clients in the variable difficulty
model.
