\begin{lemma}[$Q$-block Common-Prefix Lemma]\label{lemma:qblockcommonprefix}
	Assume $t<(\frac{1}{3}-\delta)n$ with $\delta>3\epsilon+3f$ and a $Q$-typical
	execution.
	Consider a round at which a chain $\chain$ is adopted by an honest party and
	suppose there exist another chain $\chain'$ such that
	$\chain'\setminus(\chain'\cap\chain)$ has at least $22\lambda\xi_Qf$ $Q$-blocks.
	Then, with high probability, $\chain$ has more $Q$-blocks than $\chain'$.
