\begin{abstract}
  Superlight blockchain clients which work with logarithmic communication size
  and storage have been developed for blockchains and proven secure in the model
  of constant difficulty. We give the first Non-Interactive Proof of
  Proof-of-Work scheme which is provably secure in the variable difficulty
  setting. Our construction is based on superblock NIPoPoWs. The critical
  observation is that, for the purposes of superblock NIPoPoWs, the mining
  target can be assumed to be the genesis epoch target without harm to security.
  A NIPoPoW client following this approach then extracts the chain with the most
  proof-of-work instead of the longest chain.
